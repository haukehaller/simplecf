Simple Contact Form
===================

This extension provides a very basic contact form for your TYPO3 site. Fields included are 'name', 'street', 'city',
'phone', 'email', 'message' and a 'contact by' field to let the user choose between 'phone' and 'email'. Required fields
 are by default 'name', 'message' and either 'email' or 'phone' depending on the user's selection. Unwanted fields can
 simply be removed from the templates without breaking stuff. The extension depends on ```EXT:sr_freecap``` to provide
 some spam protection.
